Blaze9 is an unofficial desktop port of Fiyah.TV built with Electron. The window is resizable, you keep all of the features of the normal website, and it just takes one click to get to! Download it now!
<h1>Compatibility</h1>
Currently only works on 64-bit Windows. Mac and Linux compatibility is expected in the future!
<h1>How to Download</h1>
All you need to do is clone or download! As simple as that!
<h1>NOTE</h1>
The file is sizable! My apologies. Trying to fix that!
